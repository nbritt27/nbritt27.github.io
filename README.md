## My Projects

Hi there! Here, I have a list of all of the projects that I am currently working on. They are all open source and on GitHub. I am also a member of Cypher Studios, with the main website [here](https://cypherstudios.net)

#PDF Editor

This is a basic and lightweight PDF Editor running off of HTML5 Canvas. It should work on most devices, and has touch controls enabled. Compared to other applications such as Kami, while this may not have as many features, it should not lag as much due to its simplicity.
