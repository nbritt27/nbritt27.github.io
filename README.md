# My Projects

Hi there! Here, I have a list of all of the projects that I am currently working on. Most are open source and on GitHub.

## Blanks Program
This python program takes a powerpoint and makes it a fill in the blanks type document, and saves it as a new file. You can then quiz yourself on the information in the powerpoint. I'm currently working on a way to save the new file in more of an outline form. In order to view and download the current version, go [here](https://github.com/nbritt27/Blanks-Program).

## Social Media Board
This web program was my high school senior project, and consists of a simple social media site that lets you follow users, post content, and interact with others posts. The current version can be found [here](https://github.com/nbritt27/Firebase_Project)

## Group Bible
Created in a consulting project with a church group, Group Bible is an application using the API.bible api that allows groups to have a single Bible to collaborate with. The current version can be found [here](https://github.com/nbritt27/group-bible).

# Not mentioned or Proprietary
Some of my projects that I work on aren't on GitHub publically, but include using python to analyze twitter data and visualizing it using Matplotlib. 
Example visualizations:

Heatmap of tweets about the US elections on election day

Much of my work involves using data science for academic manuscripts. Feel free to check out my Google Scholar profile (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tyYCmyUAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1)


Currently, I have a focus in creating dashboards of visualizations using the Javascript d3 library. If you'd like to see any more examples, please don't hesitate to reach out!
