# My Projects

Hi there! Here, I have a list of all of the projects that I am currently working on. They are all open source and on GitHub. I am also a member of Cypher Studios, with the main website [here](https://cypherstudios.net)

## Group Bible
Group Bible is an application using the API.bible api that allows groups to have a single Bible to collaborate with. The current version can be found [here](https://github.com/nbritt27/group-bible).

## Blanks Program
This python program takes a powerpoint and makes it a fill in the blanks type document, and saves it as a new file. You can then quiz yourself on the information in the powerpoint. I'm currently working on a way to save the new file in more of an outline form. In order to view and download the current version, go [here](https://github.com/nbritt27/Blanks-Program).

## Social Media Board
This web program was my high school senior project, and consists of a simple social media site that lets you follow users, post content, and interact with others posts. The current version can be found [here](https://github.com/nbritt27/Firebase_Project)

# Not mentioned
Some of my projects that I work on aren't on GitHub publically, but include using python to analyze twitter data and visualizing it using Matplotlib.
