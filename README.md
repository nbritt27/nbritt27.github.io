# About Me

Hi there! Here, I have a list of all of the projects that I am currently working on. Most are open source and on [GitHub](github.com/nbritt27). My specialty is in network graph theory, particularly in application to social media analysis. Much of this in done in conjunction with the Clemson Social Media Listening Center. Much of my work also contributes to manuscript publications under an NSF grant-funded team. You can feel free to view all of these works on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tyYCmyUAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1) account!


# Not mentioned or Proprietary
Most of my projects aren't available publically, but I've included a few sample visualizations to show the sort of work I'm involved with. 
Example visualizations:
